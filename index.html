      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Documentary filmmaking is not just about observation — it’s about intervention. It’s about entering reality with a camera and emerging with truth.
        In a time when misinformation floods our feeds and silence surrounds injustice, the documentary becomes a weapon — a form of<strong> cinematic activism<strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Led by internationally acclaimed filmmaker <strong>Hossein Martin Fazeli</strong>, this 6-day intensive workshop invites participants to explore how film can shake complacency, ignite empathy, and inspire transformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through screenings, fieldwork, and hands-on creation, participants will not only learn how to make great films but why they matter.
        Together, we’ll craft short documentaries that confront urgent social, environmental, and human realities — from Helsinki’s neighborhoods to the wider world.
